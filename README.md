## 💡 How to Use

1. Open a PostgreSQL-compatible tool (e.g., **pgAdmin**, **DBeaver**, **DataGrip**, **psql**).
2. Load and run the `.sql` files in sequence to learn the concepts.
3. Use the `.csv` files with `COPY` or `\copy` commands to import data.
4. Modify queries or schema for experimentation and deeper understanding.
